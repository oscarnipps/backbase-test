# Mobile Assignment CS
This is a placeholder README file with the instructions for the assingment. We expect you to build your own README file.

## Kick off
In order for us to kick off your assingment, please **[watch this 9 minutes video](https://youtu.be/qUkYkm9bWak)** where we will go through the assingment instructions and answer some of the questions you might have.

## Delivering the code
* Fork this repo and select the access level as PRIVATE. This is very important. **[Check how to do it here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee////user/project/working_with_projects.html#fork-a-project)**
* Do NOT open a PR to this repository.
* Add the user **m-cs-recruitment@backbase.com** as `Reporter` member **[Check how to do it here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/members/#add-a-user)**
* Once you are done with the development, send an e-mail to **m-cs-recruitment@backbase.com** AND CC the recruiter who is in touch with you with your info and repo. This helps us to keep track of your progress and move with the process faster.

Please remember to work with small commits, it help us to see how you improve your code :)

## Instructions

You should build an application using the TheMovieDB API. We have provided an initial application that will help you with fast-tracking app development. It contains the following:

* Class containing baseUrl and API key which is needed to fetch contents from TMDB API.
* Basic implementation of a scrollable list to fetch contents and display them in list format.
* Basic JSON parsing to parse server response and populate details.
* Placeholder RatingView class

### UI/UX
Below you can find the links to the layouts you need to follow. You can inspect each view to get the dimensions:

* [Android](https://app.abstract.com/share/0c431216-05c1-45d7-8304-f9e6566276bf)
* [iOS](https://app.abstract.com/share/8cb87be4-4250-45e0-9066-abcdf4d5dd79)

### Functionalities
We expect you to implement the following functionalities in the app:

1. **List horizontally currently playing movies**
	* Client API details 
		* GET https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/now_playing?language=en-US&page=undefined&api_key=55957fcf3ba81b137f8fc01ac5a31fb5
		* Only display poster images in the horizontal scrolling list view.
		* No pagination necessary.
	
2. **Display the most popular movies in the vertical list view, with multiple pages**
	* Client API details  
		* GET https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/popular?api_key=55957fcf3ba81b137f8fc01ac5a31fb5&language=en-US&page=1
		* Use the parameter page to change the list's page.
	* Implement the paging mechanism to load a list of movies as the user scrolls down the list.
	* Cache movie images, in order to make smooth scrolling.
	* Implement the custom RatingView.

		* Poster image
		* Title
		* Rating
		* Duration
		* Release date
	
3. **When a user clicks on any movie list item, it will navigate to a detailed screen, with more information about the movie**
	* Client API details 
		* GET https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/{MOVIE_ID}?api_key=55957fcf3ba81b137f8fc01ac5a31fb5&language=en-US
		* Where MOVIE_ID should be replaced with the id of the movie.

2. 3rd party libraries are allowed (except for the rating view). However, do not use any Alpha version of libraries.
3. This is not an ordinary assignment. If you notice any strange behavior, you are free to make decisions regarding the implementation or to take things out of scope, as long as your decision can be justified.

8. You are free to handle extra requirements, and this will be part of how we evaluate your work.
7. The application should be developed in portrait mode only.
